== Rationale

Clojure "endeavors to be a general-purpose language suitable in those areas where Java is suitable" (from https://clojure.org/about/rationale[Rationale]). To effectively target the JVM platform, Clojure needs to provide ready access to Java libraries, ideally in a way suited for dynamic development. In practice, this means meeting the JVM platform in two places:

* the classpath used when invoking JVM processes (and/or URLClassLoaders)
* transitive dependency download and resolution from Maven repositories

https://github.com/clojure/tools.deps.alpha[tools.deps.alpha] is a library providing a functional API to access these capabilities. tools.deps.alpha makes it simple and easy to interactively consume JVM libraries, without dragging in unrelated concerns of building programs or project management. (It should also be a useful shared resource for future work on project and build tools.)

The Clojure 1.9 release for the first time requires multiple artifacts to run Clojure (clojure, spec.alpha, and core.specs.alpha) and thus the issues of transitive dependency are now immediately in front of a Clojure user in the first minute. A new script (`clojure`, and a wrapper for interactive use `clj`) is provided by system-specific installers (e.g. brew, apt-get, etc) as a path for getting started with Clojure development.

Maven-artifacts-first orientation of current tooling has created great rigidity and friction for dev processes - making it hard to e.g. work with libs not yet building/publishing artifacts (new users!), work on speculative changes w/o artifacts, working on mutual changes across multiple libs, give control to a 3rd party tool to manage shared dependencies, and to directly leverage git which is now widely used as a source of truth for code lifecycles.

== Installation

=== Installation on Mac via `brew`

The latest development version of the Clojure scripts can be installed by selecting the `devel` version of Clojure as follows:

[source,shell]
----
brew install --devel clojure
----

If you omit the `--devel` you will instead get the latest stable version of Clojure, currently 1.8.0.

=== Installation on Linux

Package installers - COMING SOON

The following process can be used to manually install the latest devel version of the `clj` script on a *nix system.

[source,shell]
----
# Download and extract the tar file in any scratch directory
mkdir scratch
cd scratch
curl -O https://download.clojure.org/install/brew/clojure-scripts.tar.gz
tar xzf clojure-scripts.tar.gz

# Install the scripts to a directory (that must exist or be created)
export CLJ_SCRIPTS=$HOME/clojure-scripts
mkdir -p $CLJ_SCRIPTS
./install.sh $CLJ_SCRIPTS

# Add scripts to your path
export PATH=$PATH:$CLJ_SCRIPTS/bin
----

Note that you will need to remove the scripts above from your path when package installers are available. 

=== Installation on Windows

COMING SOON

== Usage

Usage:

* `clojure [<clj_opts>] [<dep_opts>] [<main_opts>]`
* `clj [<jvm_opts>] [<dep_opts>] [<main_opts>]`

where:

* `clojure` is the primary script. `clj` is a wrapper for interactive repl use. 
* `jvm_opts` is 0 or more of the following:
** `-Jopt` - passes `opt` through to the JVM, ex: `-J-server`
* `dep_opts` is any of the following (but each at most once):
** `-Ralias...` - concatenated resolve-args aliases, ex: `-R:bench:1.9`
** `-Calias...` - concatenated classpath-override aliases, ex: `-C:dev`
** `-Spath` - compute classpath and show it, without running Clojure
** `-Srepro` - use only the local deps.edn (ignore install and user deps.edn)
** `-Sforce` - force recomputation of the classpath (ignore the cache)
** `-Sverbose` - print important paths while running the clojure script
* `main_opts` are the `clojure.main` arguments, see [docs](https://clojure.org/reference/repl_and_main)

The `clojure` and `clj` scripts ultimately construct and invoke a command-line of the form:

[source,shell]
----
java <java_opts> -cp <classpath> clojure.main <main_opts>
----

The `dep_opts` are used to compute the `<classpath>` in this final invocation. Classpaths are cached (except when using `-P`) - see the section on classpath caching below for more details. When a classpath is not available, the following process is used to construct the classpath:

* Compute the deps map
** Read the deps.edn file in the following locations:
*** Install directory (unless -Srepro)
*** Config directory (if it exists and unless -Srepro)
*** Current directory (if it exists)
** Combine the deps.edn maps in that order with `merge-with merge`
* Compute the resolve-deps args
** If `-R` specifies one or more aliases, find each alias in the deps map `:aliases`
** `merge-with` `merge` the alias maps - the result is the resolve-args map
* Invoke `resolve-deps` with deps map and resolve-args map
* Compute the classpath-overrides map
** If `-C` specifies one or more aliases, find each alias in the deps map `:aliases`
** `merge` the classpath-override alias maps
* Invoke `make-classpath` with the libs map returned by `resolve-deps`, the paths, and the classpath-args map
* Write the libs map to the classpath cache
* Write the classpath to the classpath cache

== deps.edn

The deps.edn file is an instance of the `::deps-map` https://github.com/clojure/tools.deps.alpha/blob/master/src/main/clojure/clojure/tools/deps/alpha/specs.clj[spec]. The full spec is defined below:

[cols="3<*", options="header", role="table"]
|===
| Spec name | Definition | Description |
| `::deps-map` | `(s/keys :opt-un [::paths ::deps ::aliases])` | The deps.edn format |
| `::paths` | `(s/coll-of string? :kind vector? :into [])` | Paths in current project to include in classpath |
| `::deps` | `(s/map-of ::lib ::coord)` | Dependencies, a map from lib to (optional) coord |
| `::lib` | `symbol?` | A library like `org.clojure/core` or `criterium` |
| `::coord` | `(s/or :mvn :mvn/coord :local :local/coord)` | The coordinate of different types. |

| `::alias` | `keyword?` | The command line alias to use with `clj -R` or `clj -C` |
| `::resolve-args` | `(s/keys :opt-un [::extra-deps ::override-deps ::default-deps])` | Dep modifications to pass to `resolve-deps` |
| `::extra-deps` | `(s/map-of ::lib ::coord)` | Dependencies to add to the initial set |
| `::override-deps` | `(s/map-of ::lib ::coord)` | If dep is found when expanding deps, use this coordinate, regardless of what is specified |
| `::default-deps` | `(s/map-of ::lib ::coord)` | If dep is found when expanding deps and no coordinate is provided, use this coordinate |
| `::classpath-args` | `(s/keys :opt-un [::classpath-overrides ::extra-paths])` | Classpath modifications to pass to `make-classpath` |
| `::classpath-overrides` | `(s/map-of ::lib ::path)` | Override paths to use for libraries, passed to `make-classpath` |
| `::extra-paths` | `(s/coll-of string? :kind vector? :into [])` | Collection of extra paths to add to the classpath in addition to ::paths |
| `::mvn/repos` | `(s/map-of ::repo-id ::repo)` | Maven provider repo config |
| `::repo-id` | `string?` | Repository name |

== Glossary

**Library**

An independently-developed chunk of code residing in a directory hierarchy under a root.  We will narrow to those libraries that can be globally named, e.g. `my.namespace/my-lib`.

**Artifact**

A snapshot of a library, captured at a point in time, possibly subjected to some build process, labeled with a version, containing some manifest documenting its dependencies, and packaged in e.g. a jar.

**Dependency**

An expression, at the project/library level, that the declaring library needs the declared library in order to provide some of its functions. Must at least specify library name, might also specify version and other attrs. Actual (functional) dependencies are more fine-grained. 

We would like to support:

* maven artifacts
* unversioned libraries - a file location identifying a jar or directory root
* git coordinates (later)

**Classpath (and roots/paths)**

An ordered list of local 'places' (filesystem directories and/or jars) that will form root paths for searches of requires/imports at runtime, supplied as an argument to Java which controls the semantics. We discourage order-dependence in the classpath, which implies something is duplicated (and thus likely broken).

**Expansion**

Given a set of root dependencies, a full walk of the transitive dependencies.

**Resolution**

Given a collection of root dependencies and additional modifications, creates a fully-expanded dependency tree, then produces a mapping from each library mentioned to a single version to be used that would satisfy all dependents, as well as the local path. We will also include those dependents for each entry. Conflicts arise only if libraries depend on different major versions of a library.

**Classpath creation**

Creates a classpath from a resolved lib-map and optional extra local lib paths. Current plan for lib-map does not provide for control over resulting order.

**Version**

A human numbering system whose interpretation is determined by convention. Usually x.y.z. Must protect against 'semver' interpretation, which allows libraries to break users while keeping the name the same. Ascending by convention - higher numbers are 'later', vague compatibility with lower/earlier.

**Version difference**

This occurs when the dependency expansion contains the same library with more than one "version" specified but where there is a relative ordering (either by number or by SHA etc). Version differences can be resolved by choosing the "later" or "newest" version when that relationship can be established.

**Version conflict**

A version conflict occurs when the dependency expansion contains the same library with more than one "version" such that the best choice cannot be automatically chosen:

* semver version breakage (major version changed)
* github shas that do not contain any common root or ancestry (two shas on different branches for example)
* versions that cross different repos or repo types such that no relative relationship can be established

**Maven Repo**

A repository of library artifacts - e.g. Maven central or Clojars

**Requires and imports**

Mentions in source code of library (sub)components that must be in the classpath in order to succeed. namespace and package/class names are transformed into path components.

== Environment

The `clojure` and `clj` scripts rely on several directories and optionally on several environment variables. In general, as a new user of `clj`, you can ignore this section as everything is taken care of by default.

* scripts directory
** Created during installation
** Contents:
*** `bin/clojure` - main script
*** `bin/clj` - wrapper script for interactive repl use (uses `rlwrap`)
*** `deps.edn` - install level deps.edn file, with some default deps (Clojure, etc)
*** `example-deps.edn` - commented example that gets copied to `<config_dir>/deps.edn`
*** `libexec/clojure-scripts-X.Y.Z.jar` - uberjar invoked by `clojure` to construct classpaths
* config directory
** Can be created to hold a deps.edn file that carries across installation upgrades and takes affect across projects
** Locations checked in this order:
*** If `$CLJ_CONFIG` is set, then use `$CLJ_CONFIG` (explicit override)
*** If `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set, then use `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/clojure` (follows Freedesktop conventions)
*** Else use `$HOME/.clojure`
** Contents:
*** `deps.edn` - user deps file, defines default Clojure version and provider defaults
* cache directory
** Lazily created if `clojure` is invoked without a local `deps.edn` file. Locations checked in this order:
*** If `$CLJ_CACHE` is set, then use `$CLJ_CACHE` (explicit override)
*** If `$XDG_CACHE_HOME` is set, then use `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/clojure` (follows Freedesktop conventions)
*** Else use `config_dir/.cpcache`
** Contents:
*** See the section below on classpath caching

== Classpath caching

Classpath files are cached in the current directory under `.cpcache/`. File are of two forms:

* `.cpcache/<hash>.libs` - a `::lib-map` in the https://github.com/clojure/tools.deps.alpha/blob/master/src/main/clojure/clojure/tools/deps/alpha/specs.clj[specs], the output of running `resolve-deps`
* `.cpcache/<hash>.cp` - a classpath string, the output of `make-classpath`

where the `<hash>` is based on the config file paths, the resolve-aliases, and the classpath aliases.

The cached classpath file is used when:

* It exists
* It is newer than `deps.edn`
* It is newer than all of the existing config files

== Frequently Asked Questions

*Are these scripts and tools.deps.alpha done?*

No. There are lots of known gaps and ideas still to implement. But it is useful now. :)

*Is clj a replacement for lein and boot?*

No. The clojure scripts are focused on a) building classpaths and b) launching clojure programs. They do not (and will not) create artifacts, deploy artifacts, etc. 

tools.deps.alpha aims to provide programmatic building blocks for dependency resolution and classpath construction. clj/clojure wraps these into a command-line form that can be used to run Clojure programs. You can compose these pieces to do many other things.

*Do these scripts allow you to dynamically add dependencies to a running repl?*

No. Other tools exist to do this now or could be added on top of the existing functionality but this was not part of the initial goal.
